# 2D-Image-Processing

2D Image Processing. Program loads in image and then applies effects by manipulating the colour and position of its pixels. Through using C# and Visual Studio GUI I was able to create this 2D image processing program that allowed me to flip, invert, whiten and apply numerous other affects to the image.
